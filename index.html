My name is Ali Quadri, a 14 year old freshman currently attending Hoffman Estates High School.
    I was born on April 29, 2004 in Alexian Hospital in Hoffman Estates. Through out my life I have attended many
    schools in Hoffman Estates which included Eisenhower jh, John Muir, Armstrong and now HEHS.
    Overall I am an active person who likes to do anything from Gym to Computer Science.
    I like topics that include Maths, Science and related subjects. As a student in high school, feel that I have had lots
    of success previously and will try to stay that course. In the navigation bar above you will be able to see things
    relating about my Family, Hobbies, Education, and any Questions that I believe others want to know about and lastly projects
    I will do for AP Comp Sci.
